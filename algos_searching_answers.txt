### Short Answer

> 1.What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

Real life scenario of a linear search is looking at answers on a multiple
choice test.

> 2.What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

Looking up words in the dictionary would be a binary search. Flip it open, if the
word youre looking for is to the left, move left. If its to the right, move right.
Check again and again until you find the right, then do the same thing with the word.

> 3.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint,
how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear
search?

It would take 7 iterations to move to the last item in the sorted array.

> 4.Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations
would it take to find the value G using binary search?

It should take 3 iterations to find G.

> 5.Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
 choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

I would have no choice but to take the linear search because the array isnt sorted.

> 6.Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

Since its sorted, have to choose the binary search because its more efficient given large, sorted inputs.

### Programming Assignment

> 1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.


var binarySearch = function(arr, key){
	var start = 0;
	var end = arr.length -1;

	var middleIndex;

	while(start <= end){

		if( start === end){
			middleIndex = start;
		}else{
			// end + start may overflow
			middleIndex = Math.floor( (end - start) / 2 ) + start;
		}

		if(arr[middleIndex] === key){
			return middleIndex;
		}

		if(key < arr[middleIndex]){
			end = middleIndex - 1;
		}else{
			start = middleIndex + 1;
		}
	}

	return -1;
};

> 2.You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

function goldfishVerify(fish){

    if(fish.type === "whiteSpotted"){
        return 1;
    }
    else
      return -1;

}

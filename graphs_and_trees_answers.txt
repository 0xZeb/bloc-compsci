### Exercises
> 1.What is a binary tree and what makes it unique to other trees?

Binary trees are structured on each node potentially having two children nodes at most.

> 2.What is a heuristic?

Heuristics are estimations in algorithms that reduce accuracy while shortening time.

> 3.What is another problem besides the shortest-path problem that requires the use of heuristics?

Searching algorithms can hybridize with heuristics to find best answers to eliminate
search space to increase speed in large data sets.

> 4.What is the difference between a depth-first search and a breadth-first search?

DFS will explore as far down a tree as possible before backtracking. A BFS searches
across rows before moving down to the next row of nodes.

> 5.Explain in your own words what an undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph is.

A doubly-linked-list is undirected, a-cyclic, and unweighted. It does not loop,
can move in more than one direction, and edges between nodes carry no values.

> 6.What kind of graph is a binary search tree?

A binary search tree is a-cyclic, directed and unweighted.

### Programming Questions
> 1.Given a Binary Search Tree and a value, write a function that checks
to see whether the value exists within the tree.

Example: The value 10 exists in the tree. The value 23 does not exist in the tree.

// find a value
searchTree(node, data)
{
    if(node === null){
        console.log("The value " + data + " does not exist in the tree");
    }
    //compare and see which direction to go in the tree
    else if(data < node.data){
        return this.search(node.left, data);
    }
    // or move to other child
    else if(data > node.data)
        return this.search(node.right, data);

    //last state, node found then return node
    else
        console.log("The value " + data + " exists in the tree");
}


> 2.Given a Binary Search Tree and two nodes, n1 and n2, write a function that
finds the distance between the two nodes

Example: The distance between the nodes 4 and 10 is 4.
The distance between the nodes 8 and 10 is 1.
The distance between the nodes 1 and 14 is 4.

My research into this problem has shown that in order to determine distances between nodes in one traversal, you have to find a LCA or lowest common ancestor then, using a DFS determine each nodes distance from LCA. This amount is summed for a total distance.

// Helper function- you would use this method once the LCA is found.
//assumes items exist in tree- returns distance from root
int distanceFromRoot(struct Node* root, int x)
{
    if (root->key == x)
        return 0;
    else if (root->key > x)
        return 1 + distanceFromRoot(root->left, x);
    return 1 + distanceFromRoot(root->right, x);
}


/*
- Find LCA.
- Compare both keys to current node.
- As long as both are greater or less than, move appropriately down the tree.
- if both nodes move in opposite directions, or one is equal to
current node, call distanceFromRoot method.
- distance from root recursively finds nodes, then returns 1 per level descended in tree.
*/
int distanceBetween2(struct Node* root, int a, int b)
{
    if (!root)
        return 0;

    // Both keys lie in left
    if (root->key > a && root->key > b)
        return distanceBetween2(root->left, a, b);

    // Both keys lie in right
    if (root->key < a && root->key < b) // same path
        return distanceBetween2(root->right, a, b);

    // Lie in opposite directions (Root is
    // LCA of two nodes)
    if (root->key >= a && root->key <= b)
        return distanceFromRoot(root, a) +
               distanceFromRoot(root, b);
}

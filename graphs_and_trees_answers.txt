### Exercises
> 1.What is a binary tree and what makes it unique to other trees?

Binary trees are structured on each node potentially having two children nodes at most.

> 2.What is a heuristic?

Heuristics are estimations in algorithms that reduce accuracy while shortening time.

> 3.What is another problem besides the shortest-path problem that requires the use of heuristics?

Searching algorithms can hybridize with heuristics to find best answers to eliminate
search space to increase speed in large data sets.

> 4.What is the difference between a depth-first search and a breadth-first search?

DFS will explore as far down a tree as possible before backtracking. A BFS searches
across rows before moving down to the next row of nodes.

> 5.Explain in your own words what an undirected, a-cyclic, unweighted graph is.

A doubly-linked-list is undirected, a-cyclic, and unweighted. It does not loop,
can move in more than one direction, and edges between nodes carry no values.

> 6.What kind of graph is a binary search tree?

A binary search tree is a-cyclic, directed and unweighted.

### Programming Questions
> 1.Given a Binary Search Tree and a value, write a function that checks to see whether the value exists within the tree.

Example: The value 10 exists in the tree. The value 23 does not exist in the tree.

> 2.Given a Binary Search Tree and two nodes, n1 and n2, write a function that finds the distance between the two nodes

Example: The distance between the nodes 4 and 10 is 4. The distance between the nodes 8 and 10 is 1. The distance between the nodes 1 and 14 is 4.
